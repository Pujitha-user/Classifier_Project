# Classifier_Project
A text classification project using Google’s Gemini API and LangChain, without relying on traditional datasets. Implements a classifier workflow powered by LLMs and LangGraph for flexible categorization. 

```markdown
# 🧠 Classifier Project

This project demonstrates a **text classification pipeline** built using **Google Generative AI**, **LangChain**, and **LangGraph**.  
It is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook, showing how modern AI models can be used for classification tasks without requiring a dataset.  

---

## 🚀 Features
- Uses **Google Generative AI** for intelligent classification.
- Integrates with **LangChain** and **LangGraph** for streamlined workflows.
- Jupyter Notebook implementation for easy experimentation and learning.
- Lightweight and extensible for further enhancements.
